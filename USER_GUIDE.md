## Submitting an Idea

The idea submission process consists of 5 easy steps:

### Step 1: Basic Information
- **Title**: Enter a clear, descriptive title for your idea (max 100 characters)
- **Required**: This field must be filled to proceed
- **Character Counter**: Shows remaining characters as you type
- **Auto-save**: Progress is saved automatically every 30 seconds

#### Title Examples:
- ✅ **Good**: "Implement RFID Tracking for Tool Inventory Management"
- ✅ **Good**: "Reduce Assembly Line Downtime with Predictive Maintenance"
- ❌ **Poor**: "Better tools"
- ❌ **Poor**: "Fix the problem in department"

#### Title Best Practices:
- Use action words (Implement, Reduce, Improve, Optimize)
- Include specific area or process
- Mention expected outcome
- Avoid vague or generic terms

### Step 2: Problem & Solution
- **Problem Description**: Describe the current issue or challenge (max 500 words)
- **Proposed Improvement**: Explain your solution in detail (max 1000 words)
- **Required**: Both fields must be completed
- **Rich Text Support**: Basic formatting available (bold, italic, bullet points)
- **Word Counter**: Track word usage in real-time

#### Problem Description Framework:
1. **Current State**: What is happening now?
2. **Impact**: How does this affect operations, safety, or costs?
3. **Frequency**: How often does this problem occur?
4. **Scope**: Which departments or processes are affected?
5. **Root Cause**: What causes this problem?

#### Solution Description Framework:
1. **Proposed Solution**: What exactly do you suggest?
2. **Implementation Steps**: How would this be implemented?
3. **Resources Needed**: What tools, people, or budget required?
4. **Timeline**: How long would implementation take?
5. **Success Metrics**: How will success be measured?

#### Example Problem Statement:
"The current manual inventory counting process in the warehouse takes 8 hours every week and often results in 5-10% counting errors. This leads to stock discrepancies, delayed shipments, and customer complaints. The problem occurs because workers must manually count items in hard-to-reach locations without proper scanning tools."

#### Example Solution Statement:
"Implement a barcode scanning system with mobile devices for real-time inventory tracking. Install barcode labels on all inventory items and provide staff with handheld scanners. This would reduce counting time to 2 hours weekly, eliminate human counting errors, and provide real-time inventory visibility. Implementation would require 2 weeks for setup and 1 week for staff training."
